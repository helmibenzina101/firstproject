                <p class="w3-large">Tunisian cuisine, the cuisine of Tunisia, consists of the cooking traditions, ingredients, recipes and techniques developed in Tunisia since antiquity. 
                    It is mainly a blend of Mediterranean and native Punics-Berber cuisine. Historically, Tunisian cuisine witnessed influence and exchanges with many cultures and nations like Italians, Andalusians, French and Arabs.
Like many countries in the Mediterranean basin, the Tunisian cuisine is heavily based on olive oil, spices, tomatoes, seafood and meat. 
Yet, it has a distinctive spiciness that differs it from surrounding cuisines.
We also use <span
                        class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">seasonal</span> ingredients.</p>
                <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Tunisian cuisine developed from Berbers, ancient Carthage, Rome, 
                    the Islamic conquest of the Maghreb, and the Ottoman Empire. 
                    The cuisine has been strongly influenced by French and Italian (especially Sicilian) cooking</p>

                <h4>Couscous</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Couscous is the centerpiece of traditional Tunisian cuisine. This staple food, which is derived from semolina, is popular across Northern African and is present on nearly every dinner table in Tunisia 30.50</p><br>

                <h4>Merguez</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Merguez is a spicy sausage thatâ€™s made from mutton or beef (or a mixture of both). You can eat it straight off the grill or in a sandwich or Ojja.</p><br>

                <h4>Ojja</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">While typically a breakfast dish, ojja is finding its way onto lunch and dinner tables across Tunisia. Often considered fast-food by Tunisian standards, Ojja highlights the heavy influence of Berber flavors on Tunisian cuisine. Traditional ojja combines eggs and merguez, a spicy lamb sausage, in a savory tomato sauce for a hearty, filling meal 20.50</p><br>

                <h4>Chorba</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Chorba is a staple of Tunisian Ramadan meals, though you can find this delicious soup available year-round. You will typically find it made with lamb or beef, but there are also popular fish varieties (especially on the coast).</p><br>

                <h4>Masfouf</h4>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Another important dish served during Ramadan masfouf is a sweet dish made from couscous, butter, and sugar and then adorned with pomegranates, dates, or even dried grapes.</p>
